# üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant System - Customer Module

## Overview

Welcome to the **Restaurant System Customer Module**! This module allows customers to browse the menu, place orders, and receive real-time updates on their orders. The module is built using **React**, **TailwindCSS**, **Socket.io**, and **Node.js** for real-time communication with the manager and chef modules.

**Live Demo:** [Customer Module](https://restaurant-system-customer-module.netlify.app/)

## Features

- **Browse Menu**: View the restaurant's menu with detailed descriptions and prices.
- **Place Orders**: Select items and place an order directly from the app.
- **Real-time Updates**: Get notified about the status of your order in real-time.
- **Order Tracking**: Track the progress of your order from preparation to serving.

## How It Works

1. **Menu Browsing**: Customers can browse through the menu, which is managed by the manager module.
2. **Order Placement**: Once the customer places an order, it is sent to both the manager and chef modules.
3. **Real-time Notifications**: Customers receive real-time updates about their order status via **Socket.io**.
4. **Order Tracking**: The customer can see if the order is accepted, canceled, or marked as served by the manager or chef.
